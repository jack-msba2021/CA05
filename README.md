# CA05
Logistic Regression

Project Overview
This project practices building a binary classifier model to predict the CVD Risk (Yes/No, or 1/0) using a logistic regression model.


## Requirements
The following can be used to run the Python code for this project:

 - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)

  
### Installation
The following packages are needed for this project:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
from sklearn import metrics
```
